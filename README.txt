This is my final project Othello for course CS2.
In this project, I only write the code for a working AI, a ply-2 depth
optimal AI and a ply-2 depth minimax AI. In the later two AIs, first
I want to create a member function to undo a move. TAs give me hint that
I can do the move on the copied board and find the optimal moves.
In the minimax AI, I adjust the score for different squares many times to
beat SimplePlayer. Finally it works but still is not good.
There is no much time for me to complete the second part. Sorry.
